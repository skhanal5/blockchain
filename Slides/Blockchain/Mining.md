### Mining
* Accounting function to record transactions
* Incurs fees
* Mining specific ASICs exist to find new blocks
	* Nonce guesses to win the right to record the block
	* One machine randomly guesses the 32-bit nonce
* Winning machine confirms and records the transaction and collects the rewards
	* Every other node confirm the transaction and append the block to their copy of the distributed ledger
* RNG & wasteful effort deters malicious players
	* resource intensive
	* difficulty scales w/ # of nodes
	* competition ensures not one person can own the network
	* peer node validation ensures it is **fair**
